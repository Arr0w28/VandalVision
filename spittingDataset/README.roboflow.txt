The dataset includes 232 images.
Spitting are annotated in Multi-Class Classification format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
